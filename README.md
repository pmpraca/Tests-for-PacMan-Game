# Tests-for-PacMan-Game
In the context of the Software System Testing (SST) course, I developed automated tests for a previous PacMan game of mine in made in java. The tests were done with JUnit, where the test cases were done using gherkin.

In the file firstTest.feature, are the test cases written in gherkin. 
I've done tests 22 automated tests divided in 3 parts, scoring system of the game, interactions with pacman, and the FSM (finite machine state) which means the context of the game. There are 30 test cases, 22 of them automated, and the other 8 are for the interface of the game. All 30 test cases are in the firstTest.feature.

The html file shows the exported results of the tests.

The test_screenshots file contains the screenshots of the game backing up the test cases for the interface.
